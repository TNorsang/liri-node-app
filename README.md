LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search for 
1) Bands in Town for concerts
2) Search for Spotify Songs
3) OMDB for movies
4) Do what it says 

<b> This is an example on how to look up your Favorite Artist's concerts.
